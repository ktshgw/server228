"""Event hub for plugin event handling.

This module provides an event bus system that allows plugins to subscribe
to and emit events. Events are processed asynchronously in background tasks.
Listeners can declare their interest in specific event types through function annotations
and use dependency injection to receive dependencies they need.

Classes:
    EventHub: Event bus for managing event subscriptions and emissions.

Functions:
    subscribe_event: Subscribe a listener to the global event hub.
    listen: Decorator to subscribe a function to the global event hub.

Variables:
    hub: Global EventHub instance.
